## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a university project that I developed. The project is a web application that integrates various AI models to provide advanced functionalities and features. The goal of this project was to explore the application of artificial intelligence in web development and demonstrate the potential of integrating AI models into a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **AI Models Integration**: Incorporates various AI models for tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Processes data in real-time to provide instant feedback and results.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **AI Models**: TensorFlow, ResNet50

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/eXplosive57/Degree_thesis.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   
   ```sh
   cd Degree_thesis

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   
   ```sh
   npm install

4. **Start the development server:**
